							<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
							<p>The C programming language was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories, 
								and was designed to run with a UNIX operating system. The event will comprise of 3 rounds.</p><br> 
								<i>1st round : C puzzle round.</i> <br>
								<i>2nd round :Debugging round-1.</i><br>
								<i>3rd round: Debugging round-2.</i><br><br>

								•	Re-registration is allowed after the1st round.<br>
								•	It is a 3 round context.<br>
								•	The 1st round is C-Puzzle.<br>
								•	The 2nd round is Identification of errors-1.<br>
								•	The 3rd round is Identification of errors-2.<br><br>
								<strong>ROUND1:-</strong><br>
								•		A word related to programming language C will be given to the participant. From this word they have to make words with each alphabet. Cut off would be decided on-spot.Use of each alphabet of word is compulsory in minimum time.  Those participants who complete their task in minimum time will move to 2nd round. 
								For example:-UNION
								U Stands for User defined
								N Stands for Numeric
								I Stands for Integer                    
								O Stands for Overlap 
								N Stands for nested if
								<br> <br>
								<strong>ROUND2:-</strong><br>
								•	In this round the participantshave to rectify the errors in the C program code with in the given time limit. 
								The participants rectifying the maximum number of error in the shortest duration will move to the next round. Cut off would be decided on-spot.<br><br>
								<strong>ROUND3:-</strong><br>
								•	In this round the participants have to rectify the errors.In case off tie, 
								time factor would be considered inthe C program code within the given time limit. 
								The error difficulty level would be increased for this round. The participant rectifying the maximum number of errors in the shortest duration will be declared as the winner. <br><br>

														<h2>Electronic Teaser</h2>
														<h3> INTRODUCTION</h3>
														<p>An on the spot event to test very basics of electronics as well as it gives us an immense opportunity to showcase your skills at designing and implementing electronic circuits.
															Teams will be given a problem statement and they have to solve it by using components provided (ICs, breadboard, logic gates etc.) 
															within the stipulated time to prove their dominance over silicon.</p><br><br>
															<p>
																<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
																<strong>Team :-</strong><br> Maximum 2-Participants<br><br>
